- [ ] Adhere to the style guide or coding conventions specified (if any).
- [ ] Use meaningful variable and function names.

- [ ] Document any dependencies and how to install them.
- [ ] Include examples and usage scenarios.

## Testing

## Security

- [ ] Implement security best practices relevant to the assignment.

## External Feedback ( this step I have found useful )

- [ ] Share your repository with a technical friend or colleague.
- [ ] Ask for feedback on both the code and the README.
- [ ] Be open to constructive criticism and use it to improve your work.

## Final Review

- [ ] Conduct a final review of your code and documentation.
- [ ] Ensure all aspects of the assignment are addressed.

## Submission

- [ ] Submit the assignment within the specified deadline.
- [ ] Double-check that all required files are included in the submission.

## General Tips
- [ ] Avoid last minute updates that can potentially break the application
- [ ] I would recommend leaving the last day as testing, refactoring and general housekeeping.
- [ ] Any big changes should be done on a seperate branch seperate from main, and completely tested until merged.
- [ ] Bonus Tasks are great, however, they do not take precedence over the core requirements.
